This is going to be a C project for a 2D platformer experimental kind of game. I want to build it with FreeGlut.

Build the most basic possible scaffolding, considering these instructions:

* The main file must be called scene.c.
* The scaffolding only needs to open a window.
* Include the barest possible imports.  
* Add a makefile.
